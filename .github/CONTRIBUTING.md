# Contributing to the Heptagran Bot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Heptagram Bot! We have extensive documentation below to do our best to make your contribution journey as smooth as possible.

# Our Discord Server

If you ever need support with contributing to the bot, you can alway join our discord server at <https://discord.gg/yHFQWNtNDt>, where we have staff and knowledgeable people to help you out!

In this server you can also interact with the main bot, chat with other Heptagram community members, and use our collection of Heptagram stickers and emojis!

# Awsome Roles and Contribution Perks

If you have made a contribution to any of our projects, you quallify for a few awsome perks.

_To redeem **ANY** of these perks, you need to be a member of our discord server_

## Discord Role

You will gain access to the @Open Source Contributor role, giving you access to contributor only chats, and more direct abilitys to give bot feedback. _This role will also be your gateway to the #perks channel, where you can redeem/claim all other benifits._

To gain the role, ping the @Support Staff in the server, and let them know you have made a contribution. **You will need to have your Github account linked to your discord, or have proof that the account that made the contribution belongs to you.**

## Github Org Access

If you would like, we will add you to the @Heptagram-Bot-Project/Open-Source-Contributors team. This team gets you access to our internal planning boards, and is a significant step to becoming part of the offical team if you want that.

## Beta Bot

We are in the prossess of roling out a beta bot. Being an Open Source contributor will give you access to interact with the beta bot, and _potentialy_ invite it.

# Alright! Let's get into the docs on how to contribute.

## Github Issues

We use Github Issues to plan new features and track bugs. Our Github issues are labeled by priorities. Critical being the highest, and low being the lowest. We have a variety of tags you can sort issues by to find the right one for you. You cann sort by [Good First Issue](https://github.com/Heptagram-Bot-Project/bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [Help Wanted](https://github.com/Heptagram-Bot-Project/bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%F0%9F%91%90+help+wanted+%F0%9F%91%90%22), and more are being added all the time. (You can click on the above labels to be directed to a pre filtered issues view for that label.) **Please make sure to check for issues flaged with things like "Staff Only" or "ticket work required". These are issues that need staff attention, and should not be assigned to people.** Also keep you eye out for things marked as _"assigned to user"_, as someone is likely already working on this.

## Contributon Workflow

### Find a feature or bug you want to work on.

Step 1 is to find an feature or bug [Issues Page](https://github.com/Heptagram-Bot-Project/bot/issues) that you can do, or would like to try (you can always ask for help or to be unassigned).

### Assign yourself to the issue

Step 2 is when you have found what you would like to work on. When you have, please comment _.take_ on the issue, and it will be automaticly assigned to you by one of our freindly bots.

**PLEASE NOTE: The bot does not register if an issue is already assigned to someone. Please do not comment on an issue that already has someone assigned to it. Want to work on an issue with someone? If they are ok with it, go ahead and ping the @Heptagram-Bot-Project/core team on the issue, and we will assign you both.**

### Create a fork or branch

Step 3 is to create a fork or branch. **All** work should be done on a fork unless you have been added as a contributor. In that case, please use a branch off of main. We update our branches with changes frequently, so make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://dev.to/giannellitech/keeping-your-fork-up-to-date-klh)

#### Branch naming pattern

If working on a branch, please name your branch accordingly.

For a bug:
bug/_YourGithubUsername_/_IssueNumberHere_

For a feature:
feat/_YourGithubUsername_/_IssueNumberHere_

### Making changes

Step 4 is to make the necessary changes then commit your files/changes.

_Note: we do not follow a commit naming scheme. You will see commits from J-dogcoder include emojis, but that is entirely optional!_

### Check README, docs and Package.json

Step 5 is if you made changes that require updates to the documentation, making sure to update them. Also don't forget to update the version number in the package.json file!

_Need help with what place on to bump on the package.json? When you open a PR, the template will give you guidence. If confused, try your best guess, and the PR reviewer will fix it if nessisary._

**DOCS: our docs don't exist yet, so don't worry about this for now. Interested in spearheading the docs project? Reach out to J-dogcoder via the discord server.**

### Open a Pull Request!

You are so close to finishing your contribution! Step 6 is to open a pull request (aka PR) from your fork or branch into the main repo. Please open all pull requests into the staging branch. **NOT MAIN** This branch is for code not quite production ready, or that hasn't been released to the main bot yet.

### Review Prosses

Step 7 is the review prosses. This is where someone from our core team takes a look at and tests your code, to make sure it is working, and consitent with the design and values of Heptagram. Someone will review your project as soon as they can. If the reviewer requests changes, please preform them, then re-request a review.

### Merge!

Last step! LGTM! Once your PR has been appproved, it will be merged into the staged branch shortly.

### _Bonus Step_

Bonus step time! Join the discord to claim all your fabulous contributon perks! Thank you for contributing to Heptagram, and we hope you will continue to be involved in our community!

## Troubleshooting Heptagram

Heptagram is still in active development - bugs and issues are expected. If you experience a bug or issues you could not fix, do not hesitate to open a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Heptagram-Bot-Project/bot/issues/new).
