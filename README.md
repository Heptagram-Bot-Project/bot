# Welcome to Heptagram. 
The goal is for Heptagram to be the all in one, open source Discord bot to be the single needed bot for any server.
Please note, this bot is open source, but is intended to use the version we have hosted. We will be publishing a bot invite link as soon as we finish getting our hosting set up.

Heptagram has a community Discord server. You can join it at [https://discord.gg/HSupF99kpq](https://discord.gg/HSupF99kpq). In the server you can suggest features, talk with developers, and test out the bot for yourself. If you have made an Open Source Contribution, you can gain access to a special role and channels. To do so, join the server and then ping any admin and let them know.


# Open Sauced:
Heptagram is proud to work with Open Sauced and the Open Sauced discord server. Open Sauced is a website that helps you track your open source contributions and contribution goals. You can find the website at https://opensauced.pizza/. They also have an amazing Discord community and I highly recommend you check it out.
